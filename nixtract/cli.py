"""
Extraction of a graph of derivations in a flake.

Implements a CLI using `click` to be used in the terminal.

Calling this tool starts a subprocess that list top-level derivations (outputPath + attribute path) to its stderr pipe, see `./find-attribute-paths.nix`.
This pipe is consumed in a thread (`finder_output_reader`) that reads each line and feeds found attribute paths to a queue.
This queue is consumed by another thread (`queue_processor`) that will call a subprocess that describes the derivation (name, version, license, dependencies, ...), see `./describe-derivation.nix`.
When describing a derivation, if dependencies are found and have not been already queued for processing, they are added to the queue as well, which makes us explore the entire depth of the graph.

The whole system stops once
- all top-level attribute paths have been found
- all derivations from that search have been processed
- all dependencies have been processed

Glossary:
- output path: full path of the realization of the derivation in the Nix store.
               e.g. /nix/store/py9jjqsgsya5b9cpps64gchaj8lq2h5i-python3.10-versioneer-0.28
- attribute path: path from the root attribute set to get the desired value.
                  e.g. python3Derivations.versioneer
